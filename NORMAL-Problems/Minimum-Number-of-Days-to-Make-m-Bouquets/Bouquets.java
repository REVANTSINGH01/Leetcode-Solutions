/**
 * =============================================================================
 * LeetCode Problem: 1482 - Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Problem Statement:
 * You are given an integer array `bloomDay`, an integer `m`, and an integer `k`.
 * You need to make `m` bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use `k` adjacent 
 * flowers from the garden. The garden consists of `bloomDay.length` flowers, and 
 * the `i`th flower will bloom in `bloomDay[i]` days.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make `m` bouquets
 * from the garden. If it is impossible to make m bouquets, return -1.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= bloomDay.length <= 10^5
 * - 1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 10^9
 * - 1 <= m <= 10^6
 * - 1 <= k <= bloomDay.length
 *
 * Approach:
 * - Perform binary search on the range of days from min(bloomDay) to max(bloomDay).
 * - For each candidate mid day, check if we can form at least m bouquets with k adjacent flowers.
 * - In the helper function `canBloom(...)`, count adjacent bloomed flowers.
 *   If count reaches k, one bouquet is formed.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n * log(max_day - min_day))
 * Space Complexity: O(1) â€” constant extra space
